					When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

					Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

					activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
					online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
					uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
					signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
					DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
					communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
					online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
					inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
					Notice.
				</p>
				<p class="legal-text">
					California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
					browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
					legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
					respond to them at this time.
