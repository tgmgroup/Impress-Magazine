# Read the Magazine
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Read our magazine at [impress.isesaki.in](https://impress.isesaki.in).

This landing page at [impress.isesaki.in](https://impress.isesaki.in) links to each individual digital version of the magazine, such as [impress-winter-2025.isesaki.in](https://impress-winter-2025.isesaki.in). Unfortunately, the 1GB GitHub repository limit prevents us from building a monolithic app.
