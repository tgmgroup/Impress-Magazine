This is the source code for Impress Magazine's digital bookshelf. *Impress Magazine* is an English-learning magazine for young Japanese readers. This is our effort to make it more interactive and accessible for readers everywhere. 

*Impress* is produced by the Isesaki Board of Education. Development of the apps and websites is done by [Isesaki English Media](https://in.isesaki.in).

# Read the Magazine
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Read our magazine at [impress.isesaki.in](https://impress.isesaki.in).

This landing page at [impress.isesaki.in](https://impress.isesaki.in) links to each individual digital version of the magazine, such as [impress-summer-2025.isesaki.in](https://impress-summer-2025.isesaki.in). Unfortunately, the 1GB GitHub repository limit prevents us from building a monolithic app.

You can find our companion materials for all of issues here at our gallery site: [Gallery](https://in.isesaki.in/impress-gallery).

You can find our Android app here: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isesaki.impress)

We're working on an iOS app, too.
