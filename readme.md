This is the source code for Impress Magazine's digital bookshelf. *Impress Magazine* is an English-learning magazine for young Japanese readers. This is our effort to make it more interactive and accessible for readers everywhere. 

*Impress* is produced by the Isesaki Board of Education. Development of the apps and websites is done by [Isesaki English Media](https://in.isesaki.in).

## Explaining the App

This landing page at [impress.isesaki.in](https://impress.isesaki.in) links to each individual digital version of the magazine, such as [impress-winter-2025.isesaki.in](https://impress-winter-2025.isesaki.in). Unfortunately, the 1GB GitHub repository limit prevents us from building a monolithic app.

## Resources Used
